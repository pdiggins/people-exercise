# Relode Developer Exercise

The People app was originally created by one of our junior developers who is no longer with the company. In your first week with Relode you are given the task of completing this small application. The previous developer may have made mistakes or left something out. Very likely the existing code could be improved. Please feel free to make any modification to the existing code that you feel necessary.

This sample project was created using the Create React App, so there should be nothing additional needed in order to get up and running to start.

It is our hope that you would be able to complete this in a few hours. If you run out of time please leave comments indicating where you would have made certain changes or implementations.

## Getting started

You will need to fork this repository and do your work there.Once you've cloned it locally all you need to get started is `npm install` then `npm start`.   Once you have completed the changes you will need to push your changes up to your Github repo. You may send us a link to your repo.  You may also zip up your project folder and include that as an attachment in an email to us.

## Guidelines

- We want to keep the dependencies on outside npm packages to a minimum. While we use [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) and [Formik](https://formik.org/) internally, there is no expectation that you would use those in this project (but you can).
- One npm package we use, that you may find useful, is [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) so feel free to bring it into the app.
- We **do not** use Redux, so we would ask that it not be used in this sample.
- State management pattern is your option so long as "built-in" react patterns are used.
  - We do use the reducer pattern a lot along with simple local state.
  - How/if state is shared throughout the app is your preference. (e.g. prop drilling vs context). Be prepared to discuss the pros/cons of each.
- We prefer functional components over class components.
- The project has some simple styling using Sass (scss) modules. The purpose of this exercise is **not** intended to judge your artistic abilities, but rather your knowledge of CSS and at least have the UI not look awful.
- You will also notice that the application is written in TypeScript. **TypeScript is a requirement**.
- In an effort to keep the sample straightforward we have opted not to use an actual API. Instead, we have provided a simple mock up of an API in the `dataServices.ts` file. There you will find simple CRUD functions that operate on a simple, in-memory array. There should be no need to make any changes to this file.

## The People App

Currently the people app simply shows a list of people with some data fields on each one. As part of this upgrade the user needs to be able to add/remove/edit people. Additionally, we need the ability to capture a note for each person. When adding a new person we need that to be its own screen as there may be a fair amount of marketing or instructional text that will get added later. However, the edit should be inline with the grid. We would prefer that the user explicitly initiate an edit. Deleting a person simply needs a confirmation. When adding a new person the following validations should be checked when the user attempts to submit the new record:

- first and last name are required and limited to 50 characters
- email and phone are required
- note is limited to 500 characters and is optional

Now that people can get added or removed we would like to show the total number of people. The previous developer started this, but could not figure out how to do it. You should see where they left off with this.
